# mc-screen-cp

This is a CLI tool for easy managing minecraft server state. This script has some features:
* Keep minecraft server up in case of crash. So you don't need to restart your server manually after a crash
* Gives you an ability to maintain multiple servers with having an easy access to consoles of your servers

Tool is based on [screen](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Screen) so you need to install some packages before:<br>
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y default-jre screen
```
I've tested this tool only on Ubuntu, so I can't guarantee serviceability on CentOS, for example

To download mc-screen-cp you have to do this:
